### learning about Git
I am a sophomore at Yale University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. I am interested in Computer Science, Statistics and its application in computational techniques, sport analytics and financial modeling.

I am looking for opportunities to apply my background in data engineering, data visualization and statistical modelling to solve industry-related problems.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any great ideas for collaboration.
